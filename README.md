Hello! My name is Meiyi Ye, and I graduated back in June from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Data Science. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in data analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning, gaining expertise in tools like Python, R, SQL, and more.

With a passion for problem-solving, Iâ€™m excited to apply my skills in data-driven decision-making to real-world challenges. My areas of interest extend beyond data analytics to include technology, finance, and sports, where I aim to leverage insights to drive strategic improvements.
