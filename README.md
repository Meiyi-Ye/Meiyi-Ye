Hello, my name is Meiyi Ye. I am currently a 4th year pursuing a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics and Data Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My experiences and courseworks have led me to obtaining a variety of skill, including R, Python, SQL, and Tableau. I am most proficient in R and Python and enjoy exploring and performing data analytics on different datasets that interests me on kaggle.com. Currently, I am trying to sharpen up my Python skills by doing more projects using Python. 

I am interested in Data Analytics and would like to pursue a career focusing on that. Alongside Data Analytics, my other fields of interests include, finance, politics, and sports.
