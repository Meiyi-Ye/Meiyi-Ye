Hello, my name is Meiyi Ye. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics and Data Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My experiences and coursework have led me to obtain a variety of skills, including R, Python, SQL, and Tableau.

I am interested in Data Analytics and would like to pursue a career focusing on that. Alongside Data Analytics, my other fields of interest include finance, politics, and sports.
